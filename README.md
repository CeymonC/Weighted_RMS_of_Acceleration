# Weighted_RMS_of_Acceleration
## Introduction
Vehicle ride comfort with weighted root mean square (RMS) value of acceleration  
To gather the aRMS, need to input excel (.xls).  
The first column is frequency, 
the second column is acceleration in the X-direction, 
the third column is acceleration in the Y-direction, 
and the fourth column is acceleration in the Z-direction.
## Input & Outout
Input: The Frequency-PSD_Function (Power Spectral Density Function, which obtianed by performing a FFT on the a(t)).  
Output: The weighted RMS of acceleration.
